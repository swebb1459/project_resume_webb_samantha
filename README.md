[Backstretch: jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch)

This plugin makes the image fit the whole window without distorting the image. It either fits the width or the height, depending on the window size, and the rest of the image is hidden. This is applied to the body of the whole site.

[FocusPoint: jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/jonom/jquery-focuspoint)

This plugin creates a window of sorts where an image is placed. To make sure the part of the image you want to be the focus, you define area in the image and it will always be within that window. This jQuery plugin is applied to the image in the "Let's Talk" section.

[Random Text from jQuery Array](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9960909/random-text-from-jquery-array)

I wanted to create an event where, when a button is clicked, the text of another section would change. The content came from an array that was created in jQuery. In this instance, when the text/button "More testimonials" is clicked, the text above it changed. The coding inserts the content at random.

I used this site to help me figure out the array and coding to insert the new text.

[Opacity Background](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5135019/css-opacity-only-to-background-color-not-the-text-on-it)

Since I did a picture for the background for the whole site, I wanted to change the opacity of the container area. I initial just used the opacity property but that applied it to everything within the container (text, images, etc.). I didn't want that. I found this which just applied the opacity to just the background color.

[The 50 Most Useful jQuery Plugins for Frontend Development](https://speckyboy.com/2014/12/08/jquery-plugins-2014/)

This site is one I used for initial research. It was a nice way to see what is out there and what jQuery plugins could do.
